Holbertonschool-zero_day consists of these projects:

0x00-Vagrant
0x01-Emacs
0x02-Vi
0x03-Git

The purpose was to learn about each of these more in depth, as well as commands, and how to manage each thing.
We are to learn the basics of what we will be using at Holberton, it's to help us understand how working on projects will be like.
